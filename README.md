# Master_Thesis
Repository for the master thesis of Yves JÃ¤ckle, submitted for FU Berlin in december 2023.

Our code is contained in the `src` folder.

Note: this repository does not contain mathlib, which the code depends on to run. We recommend starting a new Lean project (following the instructions on https://leanprover-community.github.io/leanproject.html ), and migrating the contents of our `src` folder to that new projects source folder.

The thesis is named `MasterA_final`.
